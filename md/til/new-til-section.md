# New TIL section

Starting today, I will be using this new “Today I Learned” section to collect tidbits that may be useful to others. I've learned so much from other webistes/blogs over the years; feels right to start paying forward. This move was inspired by [Hynek Schlawack](https://hynek.me/til).

One of the first items I hope to log here is how to add an RSS feed to this section. On one hand, how hard can it be? On the other, perhaps RSS is for old people now. Who knows?
