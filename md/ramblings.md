* [Yet another static website engine](/staticwebsite): clearly the world needs one more script to generate a static website (just a bunch of html files you can copy to a server) based on a simple folder of text files.

* [Source code is your friend](/sourcecode): here is how you can process data, write up results, collaborate on a manuscript, and help others reproduce/reuse your findings, by combining the powers of Python and LaTeX with an optional dash of git.
