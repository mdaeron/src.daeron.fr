# Ramblings

I will be using this space to collect tidbits and opiniated thoughts that might be useful to others. I've learned so much from other websites/blogs over the years; feels right to start paying forward. This was inspired by Hynek Schlawack's [Today I Learned](https://hynek.me/til) section.

One of the items I hope to log here soon is how to add an RSS feed to this section. On one hand, how hard can it be? On the other, perhaps RSS is for old people now. Who knows?

* [Yet another static website engine](/ramblings/staticwebsite): clearly the world needs one more script to generate a static website (just a bunch of html files you can copy to a server) based on a simple folder of text files. The only reason I'm publishing this is to show how extremely simple it is nowadays to create your website from scratch. (2023-02-13)
