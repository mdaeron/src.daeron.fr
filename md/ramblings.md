# Ramblings

I will be using this space to collect tidbits and opiniated thoughts that might be useful to others. I've learned so much from other websites/blogs over the years; it feels right to start paying forward. This was inspired by Hynek Schlawack's [Today I Learned](https://hynek.me/til) section.

One of the items I hope to log here soon is how to add an RSS feed to this section. On one hand, how hard can it be? On the other, perhaps RSS is for old people now. Who knows?

* [tyPyt: a pain-free recipe for reproducible reports and publications](/ramblings/typyt). A talk about tools for reproducible research, aimed at people who don't know where to start (2025-08-15)
* [Modern LaTeX is not as bad as you think](/ramblings/modern-latex): painless LaTeX starting pack (2024-10-27)
* [Get BibTeX from a DOI](/ramblings/doi2bibtex): I love DOIs, love/hate BibTeX, and hate/hate manually copy/pasting bibliographic details. Let's automate. (2024-10-26)
* [Unleash the power of uv shebangs](/ramblings/uv-shebang): make Python command-line tools truly portable.  This is a much bigger deal than it sounds. (2024-10-26)
* [Yet another static website engine](/ramblings/static-website): clearly the world needs one more script to generate a static website (just a bunch of html files you can copy to a server) based on a simple folder of text files. The only reason I'm publishing this is to show how extremely simple it is nowadays to create your website from scratch. (2023-02-13)
